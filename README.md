TMBD movie case study uses the questions to make the dashboards

I recently worked on an interesting case study based on TMBD (The Movie Database) data, which involved diving into movie statistics and creating an interactive dashboard for deeper insights. The dataset included key columns such as movie ID, title, vote average, vote count, revenue, runtime, budget, and IMDb ratings.

My analysis focused on answering specific questions that provided a clearer understanding of the data. For example, I calculated the average of the vote count to determine general engagement levels for movies. I also explored the sum of vote averages to get an overall sense of how audiences rated the films. Another aspect of the study involved summing up the budget data to see how much was invested in the movies within the dataset.

To make the information more digestible, I created visualizations that showcased the titles along with their corresponding vote averages, making it easier to spot trends in audience preferences. Furthermore, the dashboard displayed IMDb ratings and revenue figures, helping to compare the financial success of films with their critical reception.

The dashboard I built allows users to interact with the data in real-time, helping them uncover patterns and make data-driven decisions. Itâ€™s always exciting to see how numbers can tell a story, and this project provided valuable insights into the movie industry.
